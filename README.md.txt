# CSS Combinators Demo

This project demonstrates the use of different CSS combinators:
- **Descendant combinator (space)**: Selects all elements inside a specific parent.
- **Child combinator (>)**: Selects direct children of a parent element.
- **Adjacent sibling combinator (+)**: Selects the element immediately following a specific element.
- **General sibling combinator (~)**: Selects all siblings that come after a specific element.

Built as part of my practice to improve my Front-End Development skills.
